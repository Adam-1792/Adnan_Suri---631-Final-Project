# Introduction

## WHAT: Since I watched the Titanic movie in 1997, I have always wanted to learn more statistical status of the Titanic ship. I hypothesize that more males died vs. females during the event. Also, I would like to know the survival age range and perform further statistical analysis to compare the data, like the overall survival rate.

## WHY: It is unfortunate that the Titanic ship sank and people died. People created a dataset to understand statistics and mainly apply those statistics for people's safety and a better world, which is very similar to the Covid dataset. Because of my interest in Titanic, I will use R language to learn more about titanic data.

## HOW: My goal would be to visualize the data by using tidyverse for titanic data manipulation and visualization. I will be doing the data analysis by using the following:

## MINIMAL: My goal would be to get more familiar with R, import titanic dataset into R, runs statistics using R functionality, especially ggplot, tidyvers, visuals where I can run the data with graphs, charts formats, and write the report in R Markdown and export in PDF.  

## AMBITIOUS: My next stretch goal would be to add more visuals and importing the dataset into Power BI ( https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-r-scripts). Installing R script into BI desktop and create “Titanic Dashboard” to run different visuals with slicer option.

# Topics From Class

### Topic 1: Lecture 8: Tidy Data a.k.a Tidyverse approach to R.
    ## 1) Use R functionality to analyze the data using ggplot 2 (data visualization)
    ## 2) R functionality dplyr (data manipulation)
    ## 3) R funtionality tidyr (data cleaning)

### Topic 2: Chapter 2, Summarizing the data. 
    ## 1) Examine the numerical data using scatterplot, histogram, standard deviation, boxplot, quaterlies and median. 
    ## 2) Analyze data by considering categorical data;
          tables and barplots - class Hw-3 
        
### Topic 3: Distribution of random variables try with R
    ## 1) Normal distribution - plot(x, qnorm(x))
    ## 2) Geometric distribution - plot(x, gnorm(x))
    ## 3) Binomial distribution - plot(x, bnorm(x))
    ## 4) Negative binomial distribution - plot(x, pnorm(x))

### Topic 4: Introduction to linear regression try with R
    ## 1) Understand Titanic data and define the correlation
    ## 2) Draw different residual plots and analyse the data
    
### Topic 5: R Shinny app
    ## 1) If time permits than will create a dashboard using R Shinny app
    ## 2) Analyze the data and visualization

     ********************************************************************************************
#### Topic 2: Chapter 2, Summarizing the data

There are 891 observations and 12 variables. It is a tibble: 891 x 12 with 7 <dbl> - hold the numeric values with decimal points and 5 <chr>

```{r}
titanic <- read.table('titanic.csv',header = TRUE, sep = ",")
summary(titanic)
```

```{r}
dim(titanic)
length(dim(titanic))
names(titanic)
```

```{r}
plot(hist(titanic$Age))
```

```{r}
head(titanic)
```

```{r}
tail(titanic)
```

```{r}
summary.data.frame(titanic)
```

```{r}
summary(titanic$Age)
```

```{r}
table(titanic$Survived)
```

```{r}
table(titanic$Sex)
```


```{r}
table(titanic$Pclass)
```

```{r}
table(titanic$Pclass) ->pclass 
prop.table(pclass)*100
round(pclass, digits=1) ->pclass
pclass

```

```{r}
gender_survived <- table(titanic$Sex, titanic$Survived)
mosaicplot(gender_survived)
```


```{r}
barplot(table(titanic$Survived))
```


```{r}
barplot(table(titanic$Sex))
```

```{r}
boxplot(titanic$Age ~ titanic$Pclass)
```

```{r}
hist(titanic$Age, breaks = 50)
```
